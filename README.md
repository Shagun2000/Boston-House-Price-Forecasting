The Boston House Price Prediction project is based on a dataset called the Boston Housing Dataset. This dataset contains information about various factors that can influence house prices in the Boston area. These factors include variables such as crime rate, average number of rooms per dwelling, accessibility to highways, air pollution levels, and more. The project aims to utilize this dataset to develop machine learning models that can predict house prices based on these factors. By analyzing the relationships between the input variables and the target variable (house prices), the project seeks to uncover patterns and create accurate prediction models.

Model Training: Different regression models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting are trained on the preprocessed data to learn the patterns and relationships between the features and target variable.

Model Evaluation: The trained models are evaluated using various performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared to assess their accuracy and predictive power.

Results and Insights: The project provides insights into the factors that most significantly influence house prices in the Boston area and allows for accurate predictions of housing prices based on the selected model.
